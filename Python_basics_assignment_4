1. What exactly is []?
Ans - in python whenever we use  or see [] this called as lists
2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
Ans - spam.insert(2,’hello’)

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
Ans - “d”

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
Ans -  -1 means it will start from last so the ans is last index “d”

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
Ans - [:2] means it will start from 0 and give output till 2 i.e sp it will print 0th and 1st index  ‘a’ and ‘b’

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
Ans -  1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
Ans -  bacon.append(99) will add 99 at the index in the list  [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True,99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
Ans - this will remove first occurrence of ‘cat’ from the list [3.14,11,’cat’, True]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
And - for list replication, we can use listname.copy() function and for list concatenation, we can use “+” operator

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
And - append() will add the item at the last index and with the help of insert() we can add to any index position

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
Ans - using pop and remove

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Ans - List and string both are used to store value /data and both are sequences.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Ans Tuples are immutable and lists are mutable this is the main difference between tuples and lists

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
Ans - tuple = (42)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
Ans - using type conversion 

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
Ans - A deep copy creates a copy of the object as well as elements of the object and A copy creates a copy of the object only
